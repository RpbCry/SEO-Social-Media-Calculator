## How to Use
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
The GUI window will appear with multiple tabs, each corresponding to a specific calculation.
Enter the required values in the input fields.
Click the `Calculate` button to obtain the result.
The result will be displayed below the `Calculate` button.
To copy the result, click the `Copy Result` button.
The progress bars on some tabs visually indicate the quality of the calculated result.

Ensure you have a Python interpreter installed on your system. The GUI might not work as expected on platforms other than Windows due to differences in the tkinter library's appearance.

Feel free to customize and extend the script to include additional SEO and social media metrics or enhance the user interface.
